# Which of the following is **NOT** a defining attitude of science that guides the work of all scientists?

This question tests your knowledge of the core principles that define science as a discipline. Consider which of the options aligns with objective, empirical investigation.

> Think about what makes science different from other ways of understanding the world!

- [ ] Determinism
> Determinism is a core assumption in science [1].
- [ ] Empiricism
> Empiricism is the practice of objective observation and measurement and a key component of science [2, 3].
- [ ] Experimentation
> Experimentation, involving controlled comparisons, is a basic strategy of most sciences [4-6].
- [x] Mentalism
> This is the correct answer. **Mentalism**, which relies on unobservable constructs, is contrary to the empirical approach of science [7, 8].

# According to the source text, what is the **primary reason** science is a self-correcting enterprise that ultimately gets it right?

This question focuses on how scientific knowledge is validated and refined over time.

> What mechanism ensures that scientific findings are reliable and mistakes are identified?

- [ ] The infallibility of scientists
- [ ] The inherent honesty of scientists
- [x] Replication
> This is the correct answer. **Replication** is key to verifying findings and correcting mistakes in science [9]. It ensures the reliability and usefulness of scientific discoveries.
- [ ] Philosophic doubt
> While philosophic doubt is important, replication is the primary reason [9, 10].

# What is the **philosophical position** that the truth value of a statement is a function of how well the statement promotes effective action?

This question requires you to identify a philosophical stance related to the practical utility of knowledge.

> Which philosophy emphasizes the importance of effective action as a measure of truth?

- [ ] Determinism
> Determinism is the assumption that the universe is lawful and orderly [1].
- [ ] Empiricism
> Empiricism involves objective observation and measurement [2, 3].
- [ ] Parsimony
> Parsimony favours simpler explanations [11].
- [x] Pragmatism
> This is the correct answer. **Pragmatism** values effective action as the measure of truth [12]. Consider how well a statement enables successful intervention.

# According to the source text, what is the **key point of behaviourism**?

This question asks you to identify the central tenet of behaviourism as it relates to understanding and influencing behaviour.

> What does behaviourism consider to be the primary influence on behaviour?

- [ ] Understanding inner selves
- [x] Arranging environments to make desired behaviours more probable
> This is the correct answer. **Behaviourism** focuses on how the environment influences behaviour [13]. The goal is to arrange environments to make desired behaviours more likely.
- [ ] Remaking inner selves
- [ ] Understanding thoughts and feelings
> Behaviourism focuses on observable behaviours rather than internal states [7, 14, 15].

# What is the **hallmark of ABA** in the logic of behaviour analysis?

This question tests your understanding of the defining characteristics of applied behaviour analysis.

> What is a key feature of ABA that distinguishes it from other approaches?

- [x] Constant reaction to a lack of progress
> This is the correct answer. Applied behaviour analysis is characterised by **continuous monitoring and adjustment based on data** [16, 17]. A constant reaction to a lack of progress is a definitive hallmark of ABA.
- [ ] Ignoring failures
> ABA embraces the lessons learned from failures [16, 17].
- [ ] Valuing false knowledge
- [ ] Guessing and guessing again
> ABA uses a scientific approach of testing and refinement rather than guesswork [18, 19].

# According to Baer, Wolf, and Risley (1968), which of the following is **NOT** one of the seven dimensions of applied behaviour analysis?

This question requires you to recall the key dimensions that define ABA according to a seminal work in the field.

> Think about the characteristics that define what ABA is and what it aims to achieve!

- [ ] Applied
> The applied dimension focuses on socially significant behaviours [20].
- [ ] Behavioral
> The behavioral dimension entails precise measurement of behaviour [21].
- [ ] General
> The generality dimension produces behaviour changes that last over time [22].
- [x] Hypothetical
> This is the correct answer. The seven dimensions are **applied, behavioral, analytic, technological, conceptually systematic, effective, and generality** [23-26].

# What does it mean for a study in applied behaviour analysis to be **conceptually systematic**?

This question tests your understanding of how interventions in ABA are linked to basic principles of behaviour.

> How are procedures and interpretations described in a conceptually systematic approach?

- [ ] Procedures are described in vague terms for broad interpretation.
- [ ] Procedures are derived from complex statistical analyses.
- [x] Procedures and interpretations are described in terms of relevant principles of behavior.
> This is the correct answer. A conceptually systematic approach ensures that interventions are **linked to basic principles of behaviour** [27]. This integration helps build a cohesive and expandable technology.
- [ ] Procedures are based on hypothetical constructs.
> ABA avoids hypothetical constructs, preferring observable and measurable events [8].

# What are the **twin goals** of applied behaviour analysis?

This question asks you to identify the two primary objectives that ABA seeks to achieve.

> What two key outcomes does ABA strive for?

- [ ] Description and Prediction
- [x] Improvement and Understanding
> This is the correct answer. ABA aims to both **improve socially significant behaviors and understand the variables responsible for those changes** [28].
- [ ] Control and Description
- [ ] Prediction and Control
> While control is a level of scientific understanding, the twin goals are improvement and understanding [29].

# What is the **primary activity** in the experimental analysis of behavior (EAB)?

This question focuses on the main activities conducted within the realm of EAB.

> What type of experiments are conducted in EAB, and what is their purpose?

- [ ] Helping people behave more successfully
- [ ] Designing, conducting, interpreting, and reporting applied experiments
- [x] Designing, conducting, interpreting, and reporting basic experiments
> This is the correct answer. **EAB focuses on basic research to discover fundamental principles of behaviour**, often in laboratory settings [30, 31].
- [ ] Conceptual and philosophical analysis
> This is more aligned with radical behaviourism [32].

# According to the source text, what is **translational research**?

This question requires you to identify the role and scope of translational research within behaviour analysis.

> How does translational research relate to basic and applied research?

- [ ] Research that only focuses on basic principles of behaviour
- [ ] Research that only focuses on applied settings
- [x] Basic research that "bridges" basic and applied areas
> This is the correct answer. Translational research **connects basic and applied research, fostering a bidirectional exchange of knowledge** [33].
- [ ] Research that is independent of both basic and applied domains
